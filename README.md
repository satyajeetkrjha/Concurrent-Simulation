# Concurrent-Simulation
This project demonstrates concurrent simulation of workers in factory .There is a shared space and part workers brings parts to the factory while product workers take them to build products .
It involves good use of mutex ,condition variables and some magical code to demonstrate concurrency .
Second code uses buffer to do the same task as first .
